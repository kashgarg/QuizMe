# My Personal Project

## Flashcard Application

#### **What will this application do?**
This application will allow you to create flashcards and 
organize them into sets. The application will let you 
enter information about the question and answer of each
flashcard, as well as the name of the set. The application
will allow you to quiz yourself by being presented the 
question side of the flashcard and have a space for 
you to input the answer.

#### **Who will use it?**
This application is for anyone who wants to create their
own flashcards and memorize terms and/or questions. 
This flashcard application would be especially useful
for students learning new languages, as they can use this
application to memorize vocabulary.

#### **Why is this project of interest to you?**
I am currently taking a foreign language course at UBC
as I am interested in learning languages, and there are
many vocabulary words I need to memorize. Since I enjoy
learning languages, this project would allow me to build
something related to language learning.
