# QuizMe

## **What is QuizMe?**
QuizMe is a quiz application that allows users to create flashcards 
and organize them into sets. QuizMe allows users to remove 
unwanted flashcards or sets, and also view created flashcards
and sets. Your created flashcards and sets can also be saved 
and loaded. The application will allow you to quiz yourself by
being presented the question side of the flashcard and a space 
for you to input the answer.

## **Who is QuizMe for?**
This application is for anyone who wants to create their
own flashcards and memorize terms and/or questions. 
This flashcard application would be especially useful
for students learning new languages, as they can use this
application to memorize vocabulary.

## **Why did I make QuizMe?**
This project was chosen because I am interested in learning languages,
and making QuizMe allowed me to develop a tool to help with 
memorization of vocabulary words.
